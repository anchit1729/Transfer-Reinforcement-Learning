# Transfer Learning Applications for Reinforcement Learning Models

This is a basic project studying the effects of applying simple cross-task/cross-domain transfer learning to reinforcement learning models by fine-tuning weights. 
Since the files used in this project are quite large, the entire project and its associated files are stored on Google Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17d66zUV12Xu5XQYfb1k9eP81Q6L2pq3D?usp=sharing)
and the main notebook can be tested out on the Google Colab platform (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e0cgGJyrW7-focWSGmmmcCtgNmFnXxMi/view?usp=sharing), provided the directory structure is left unmodified.
